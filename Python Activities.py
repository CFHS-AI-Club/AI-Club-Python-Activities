# Activity 1: Basic Calculator
''' <<<<<< REMOVE THESE WHEN YOU START WORKING
# Objective: Create a basic calculator that can perform operations based on user input.
def calculator(operation, a, b):
    # Perform the operation on a and b. Operations are "add", "subtract", "multiply", "divide"
    if operation == "add":
        return a + b
    # Add more conditions for other operations

# Example usage:
# Uncomment to test once you've implemented the function.
# print(calculator("add", 5, 3))

# Activity 2: Sort a List

# Objective: Write a function that sorts a list of numbers in ascending order.
# TODO: Implement a sorting algorithm to sort 'my_list'.
#       You can use the built-in sorted() function for an initial solution,
#       but try implementing your own sorting logic (e.g., bubble sort, selection sort, etc.) for a challenge.

# Example usage:
# Uncomment to test once you've implemented the function.
# print(sort_list([3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6]))

# Challenge 1: Simple Data Visualization
# Objective: Use Matplotlib to plot a simple graph of your choice (e.g., temperature over a week).
# You'll need to install matplotlib if you haven't already. Use: pip install matplotlib
#import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

temps = [22, 24, 19, 24, 27]

# Uncomment to test once you've implemented the function.

# Challenge 2: Prime Number Finder
# Objective: Find all prime numbers up to a given limit.
# You'll need to implement a function to check if a number is prime.
# TODO: Implement logic to find all prime numbers up to 'limit'.
#       Remember, a prime number is only divisible by 1 and itself.
#       Return a list of all prime numbers found.

# Challenge 3: Introduction to Machine Learning with Scikit-learn

# Objective: Use scikit-learn to train a simple model and make predictions.
# You'll need to install scikit-learn if you haven't already. Use: pip install -U scikit-learn

#from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
